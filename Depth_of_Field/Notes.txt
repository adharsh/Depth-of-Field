VAO - vertex array object, contains:
	VBO - Vertex Buffer Object - vertices
	EBO - Element Buffer Object - indicies
Can't unbind ebo before undbinding vao
	otherwise ebo will be lost

Pass a pointer to something you want to change
	A pointer to a pointer necessary if that pointer needs to be changed
	Otherwise that pointer value is passed, not the reference

If you get nvcc fatal   : A single input file is required for a non-link phase when an outputfile is specified
	non trivial problem with trivial solution, change intermediates folder from
		$(SolutionDir)$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\Intermediates\
		to
		..\$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\Intermediates\
	Other possible answers are having spaces in build names (eg: Inter mediates)
		extra quotes -> compiler might interpret differently (eg: "\"Intermediates"dfs", take out inner)
		etc.:
