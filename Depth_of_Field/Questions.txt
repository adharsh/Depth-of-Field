Can do a lot of things with it:
	3D environments -> since they're static, compute one SAT and perform blurs
	Foveated rendering involves one eye left and one eye right as separate passes
		Can just do once
	Companies like AT&T and Netflix -> can save bandwidth
	
	just pass in SAT instead of actual frames of video, code will simply take looking point
	no extra processing
		instead of specialized hardware that has to do all kinds of computation for blurring
 

Still don't understand overall goal of project, why sending this to other servers more efficient?
	You also said goal was to find an efficient data structure?

I understand what aDon't understand what a "restricted quad tree" is and purpose of it

Previously in notes you had mentioned to create a SAT twice as large, didn't understand why?

How does formula work? http://hipersayanx.blogspot.com/2015/07/integral-image-and-image-blur.html work
Intuition and stuff

It was really hard to find resourcses that explain this stuff
	Specific books with proofs of the math
	Specific foveated rendering papers you had in mind

The goals by next week, have a general outline of the paper, which format? NeuroIPS? Any guidelines for this?
Have the complete demo working -> explain why the summed area table is slow tho, the week after that is fixing that


Ph.D. students just in case

Also working on this other project
Better computer with more cuda cores -> access to workstations

1. summed area table replaces conv filter, to compute the blur effect?
But how to create a circle if it's square?

2. When you're rendernig the blurred image, the shader is still sampling from the texture and blurring it, its not sampling less, so why is this more efficient?

3. Why a larger map, twice the size for points on corners?

3.5. Couldn't find anything on "restricted" Quadtrees, wdym?:
